## Building

### MSVS
 - This is the only way to reliably get binaries that work on XP, however, MinGW can also be used.
 Make sure you have Visual Studio 2010 - 2022 installed. Install the [v141_xp toolset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/configuring-programs-for-windows-xp)
if using MSVS 2017/2019/2022. In an MSVS terminal with `msbuild` in your path, invoke:

(Debug)
```cmd
  msbuild.exe /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x86 xp_activate32.sln
```

(Release)
```cmd
  msbuild.exe -p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x86 xp_activate32.sln
```

 - Replace `/p:Platform=x86`with `/p:Platform=x64` to make a 64 bit build suitable for Windows XP x64.

 The executable will be placed in corresponding __Debug__ or __Release__ directory.

### MinGW

From a MinGW prompt (you may have to edit the `HOST` and/or `CC`/ `CXX`/ `LD`/ `RC` variables in the commandline or [Makefile](./Makefile)):

```bash
  make clean && make all
```

 The executable will be placed in the root directory, side by side with the Makefile.
